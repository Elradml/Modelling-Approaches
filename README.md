# Modelling-Approaches

The post processing of data as part of an assignment using Ansys Fluent CFD simulations on the ONERA M6 3D wing investigating RANS methods ability to capture shock position shock-boundary layer interactions
Also including the journal files to setup each RANS model (no mesh because the mesh and model was provided as part of the assignment)
The models investigated were:
1) Spalart-Allmaras
2) K-&#969; SST
3) K-&#969; Baseline
4) K-&#949; Standard
5) K-&#949; RNG
